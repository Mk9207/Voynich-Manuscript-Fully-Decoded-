# Comparison with Previous Hypotheses

This decoding effort has been cross-validated with major historical hypotheses:
- D'Imperio's structure-based interpretations
- EVA transliteration framework
- Herbal and alchemical theory mappings
- Voynichese linguistic analysis

Results show partial correspondence with known encoding structures, but our approach reveals deeper linguistic patterns aligning with agglutinative syntactic families.
