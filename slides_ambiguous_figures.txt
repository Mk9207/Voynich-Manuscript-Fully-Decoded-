# Slide 1: Ambiguous Figures in the Voynich Manuscript
- Strange, unrecognizable plants
- Bathing women in tubs
- Concentric stars and wheels

# Slide 2: Constructive Reinterpretation
- Not realism → Symbolic metaphors
- Each part = linguistic function (root = flow, flower = emit)
- Female cycles = body-fluid-renewal logic

# Slide 3: Meta-Diagram Concept
- All diagrams express recursive functions
- Conceptual rather than observational
- Integrates μ-function meaning structure

# Slide 4: Conclusion
- Ambiguity = symbolic function
- Full consistency with structure + semantics
- Not an obstacle but a key to understanding
