## 📘 Interpretation of Ambiguous Figures

Although some illustrations in the Voynich Manuscript appear unrecognizable:

### 🔍 Constructive Meaning Mapping

- 🌱 **Strange Plants**: Symbolize functions (root = flow, stem = cycle, flower = emit)
- 🧍‍♀️ **Female Figures**: Depict bodily cycles (fluid-body-cycle = cleansing)
- 🌌 **Star Circles**: Represent celestial periodicity and cosmic cycles

These are not errors or fabrications, but:
> **Functional diagrams of nature, body, and universe**

Therefore, ambiguity is a feature of symbolic encoding, not a barrier to interpretation.
